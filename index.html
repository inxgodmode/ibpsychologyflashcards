                <div class="flashcard-front">What was HM's background and what led to his surgery?</div>
                <div class="flashcard-back">HM was born in 1926 in Manchester, Connecticut. At age 7, he was hit by a cyclist, causing a head injury. Epileptic seizures started at age 10, likely due to the accident. By age 27, seizures were so severe that he couldn’t lead a normal life. Neurosurgeon William Scoville performed an experimental surgery, removing tissue from the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, on both sides of HM’s brain.</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="flashcard-container">
            <div class="flashcard" onclick="this.classList.toggle('flipped')">
                <div class="flashcard-front">What was the aim of Milner’s (1966) study on HM?</div>
                <div class="flashcard-back">To investigate the effects of HM’s surgery (removal of the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe) on his memory and cognitive functions, particularly the role of the hippocampus in memory formation.</div>
            </div>
        </div>

                <div class="flashcard-front">What research methods did Milner use to study HM?</div>
                <div class="flashcard-back">Milner used method triangulation: psychometric testing (IQ tests), direct observation of behavior, interviews with HM and his family, cognitive testing (memory recall and learning tasks like reverse mirror drawing), and later MRI scans (by Corkin in 1992 and 2003) to assess brain damage.</div>

                <div class="flashcard-front">What were the key findings about HM’s memory after the surgery?</div>
                <div class="flashcard-back">HM had severe anterograde amnesia (couldn’t form new episodic or semantic memories) and mild retrograde amnesia (lost about 1 year of memories before the surgery). He retained childhood memories, procedural memories (e.g., mowing a lawn), and working memory (e.g., recalling numbers with rehearsal). He could form cognitive maps (e.g., drawing his house layout) but couldn’t recall learning new skills like reverse mirror drawing.</div>

                <div class="flashcard-back">HM’s case shows the hippocampus is critical for transferring short-term memories to long-term memory. Its removal caused anterograde amnesia, but short-term and procedural memories were intact, indicating these are stored elsewhere in the brain.</div>

                <div class="flashcard-back">MRI scans (conducted by Corkin in 1992 and 2003) revealed damage to HM’s hippocampus and medial temporal lobe. This confirmed the hippocampus’s role in memory formation, as its damage explained HM’s inability to form new long-term memories.</div>

                <div class="flashcard-front">How does HM’s case study demonstrate research methods in the cognitive approach?</div>
                <div class="flashcard-back">It’s a longitudinal case study using method triangulation (psychometric testing, interviews, observation, cognitive tasks). This allowed in-depth analysis of HM’s memory deficits over 50 years, providing rich qualitative and quantitative data.</div>

                <div class="flashcard-front">How does HM’s case evaluate the Multi-Store Model of memory?</div>
                <div class="flashcard-back">HM’s case supports the Multi-Store Model by showing a distinction between short-term memory (intact, as he could hold conversations) and long-term memory (impaired, as he couldn’t form new memories). However, it challenges the model by showing procedural memory and cognitive maps were intact, suggesting long-term memory has multiple stores not accounted for in the model.</div>

                <div class="flashcard-back">Longitudinal design (over 50 years) allowed observation of changes over time. Method triangulation provided comprehensive data. High ecological validity, as HM was studied in his natural environment. Ethical standards were met (consent, confidentiality, protection from harm).</div>

                <div class="flashcard-front">What are the limitations of Milner’s study on HM?</div>
                <div class="flashcard-back">As a case study, it’s hard to replicate, limiting generalizability. Some data was retrospective, lacking pre-accident cognitive baselines. Epilepsy medication may have contributed to brain damage, though this is less relevant since the focus is on the hippocampus’s role.</div>

                <div class="flashcard-back">Used MRI scans analyzed with two techniques: voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to measure grey matter density, and pixel counting to calculate the hippocampal area.

                <div class="flashcard-back">Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to change its neural structures in response to the environment and cognition.

                <div class="flashcard-back">45 students were divided into 5 groups (independent samples design). They watched 7 films of car accidents (5–30 seconds long). After each film, they gave an account of the accident and answered a questionnaire. The critical question varied: “About how fast were the cars going when they [smashed/collided/bumped/hit/contacted] each other?” Speed estimates were recorded.</div>

                <div class="flashcard-back">Mean speed estimates varied by verb: “smashed” (40.8 mph), “collided” (39.3 mph), “bumped” (38.1 mph), “hit” (34.0 mph), “contacted” (31.8 mph). Results were significant (p ≤ 0.005), showing the verb influenced speed estimates, likely due to schema activation or response bias.</div>

                <div class="flashcard-back">150 students were randomly assigned to 3 groups. They watched a 1-minute film of a car accident (4 seconds of crash). Group 1 was asked, “How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?” Group 2 was asked the same with “hit.” Group 3 wasn’t asked about speed. One week later, all answered a questionnaire with the critical question: “Did you see any broken glass?” (There was none in the film.)</div>

                <div class="flashcard-back">“Smashed” group estimated higher speeds (10.46 mph) than “hit” group (8.00 mph). More in the “smashed” group (16) reported seeing broken glass compared to “hit” (7) and control (6). Chi-square test was significant (p ≤ 0.025), showing “smashed” led to more false memories of broken glass due to schema activation.</div>

                <div class="flashcard-back">Shows memory (reconstructive memory) is unreliable. Leading questions (e.g., “smashed” vs. “hit”) distort recall, as schemas activated by wording change memory (e.g., higher speed estimates, false recall of broken glass), highlighting memory’s susceptibility to post-event information.</div>

                <div class="flashcard-back">Lab experiments with controlled variables (IV: verb in question; DV: speed estimate, recall of broken glass). Independent samples design (Experiment 1) and random allocation (Experiment 2).

                <div class="flashcard-back">Low ecological validity—watching films lacks the emotional impact of real accidents, limiting generalizability. Student sample (young, inexperienced drivers) may not represent the general population. Artificial setting (lab) may not reflect real-life memory processes.</div>
