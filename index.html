            <div class="flashcard-front">What was HM's background and what led to his surgery?</div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">HM was born in 1926 in Manchester, Connecticut. At age 7, he was hit by a cyclist, causing a head injury. Epileptic seizures started at age 10, likely due to the accident. By age 27, seizures were so severe that he couldn’t lead a normal life. Neurosurgeon William Scoville performed an experimental surgery, removing tissue from the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, on both sides of HM’s brain.</div>

            <div class="flashcard-front">What was the aim of Milner’s (1966) study on HM?</div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">To investigate the effects of HM’s surgery (removal of the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe) on his memory and cognitive functions, particularly the role of the hippocampus in memory formation.</div>

            <div class="flashcard-front">What research methods did Milner use to study HM?</div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">Milner used method triangulation: psychometric testing (IQ tests), direct observation of behavior, interviews with HM and his family, cognitive testing (memory recall and learning tasks like reverse mirror drawing), and later MRI scans (by Corkin in 1992 and 2003) to assess brain damage.</div>

            <div class="flashcard-front">What were the key findings about HM’s memory after the surgery?</div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">HM had severe anterograde amnesia (couldn’t form new episodic or semantic memories) and mild retrograde amnesia (lost about 1 year of memories before the surgery). He retained childhood memories, procedural memories (e.g., mowing a lawn), and working memory (e.g., recalling numbers with rehearsal). He could form cognitive maps (e.g., drawing his house layout) but couldn’t recall learning new skills like reverse mirror drawing.</div>

            <div class="flashcard-front">How does HM’s case study demonstrate localization of function in the brain?</div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">HM’s case shows the hippocampus is critical for transferring short-term memories to long-term memory. Its removal caused anterograde amnesia, but short-term and procedural memories were intact, indicating these are stored elsewhere in the brain.</div>

            <div class="flashcard-front">What brain study technique was used in HM’s case, and what did it reveal?</div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">MRI scans (conducted by Corkin in 1992 and 2003) revealed damage to HM’s hippocampus and medial temporal lobe. This confirmed the hippocampus’s role in memory formation, as its damage explained HM’s inability to form new long-term memories.</div>

            <div class="flashcard-front">How does HM’s case study demonstrate research methods in the cognitive approach?</div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">It’s a longitudinal case study using method triangulation (psychometric testing, interviews, observation, cognitive tasks). This allowed in-depth analysis of HM’s memory deficits over 50 years, providing rich qualitative and quantitative data.</div>

            <div class="flashcard-front">How does HM’s case evaluate the Multi-Store Model of memory?</div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">HM’s case supports the Multi-Store Model by showing a distinction between short-term memory (intact, as he could hold conversations) and long-term memory (impaired, as he couldn’t form new memories). However, it challenges the model by showing procedural memory and cognitive maps were intact, suggesting long-term memory has multiple stores not accounted for in the model.</div>

            <div class="flashcard-back">Longitudinal design (over 50 years) allowed observation of changes over time. Method triangulation provided comprehensive data. High ecological validity, as HM was studied in his natural environment. Ethical standards were met (consent, confidentiality, protection from harm).</div>

            <div class="flashcard-back">As a case study, it’s hard to replicate, limiting generalizability. Some data was retrospective, lacking pre-accident cognitive baselines. Epilepsy medication may have contributed to brain damage, though this is less relevant since the focus is on the hippocampus’s role.</div>

            <div class="flashcard-back">Demonstrates decision-making (a cognitive process) is unreliable due to anchoring bias. Participants’ estimates were heavily influenced by the first number (1 or 8), showing heuristics lead to systematic errors in judgment rather than accurate reasoning.</div>

            <div class="flashcard-back">Simple, replicable experiment with high internal validity—controlled conditions allowed a causal link between anchor and estimate. Use of median reduced outlier influence. Supported by other studies (e.g., Plassman et al, 2008) showing anchoring in real-world contexts.</div>

            <div class="flashcard-back">Low ecological validity—estimating a math problem in 5 seconds is artificial, limiting real-world applicability. Independent samples design may introduce participant variability (e.g., math skills). A matched pairs design would better control for this.</div>
